object classes.
Volume of a cylinder : V = rÂ²h
where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.

7. Make a program to sort out the numbers in ascending order.
var numbers [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];

8. Make a program to modify that array & return 0 in place of -1
var numbers = [21,-1, 3, 50,-2, 10];

9. Make a program to sort out that array by title.
var library = [ { author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead',

libraryID: 4264}, { author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay:

Expected output should be:
[{"author":"Suzanne Collins","title":"Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger
Games","libraryID":3245}, {"author":"Bill Gates","title":"The Road Ahead","libraryID":1254},
{"author":"Steve Jobs","title":"Walter Isaacson","libraryID":4264}]

10. Make a program to find out the book by name..
var library [{ author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead',
libraryID: 1254}, { author: 'Steve Jobs', title: 'Walter Isaacson',
libraryID: 4264}, { author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay:
